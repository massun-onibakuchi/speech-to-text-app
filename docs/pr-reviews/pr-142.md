- Title: `test(e2e): make fake-audio smoke assert UI path deterministically`
- Review method: sub-agent (`explorer`) + manual validation

## Findings

- Medium: The fake-audio smoke test stopped asserting that the renderer submitted recorded audio, so it became blind to regressions where the UI reaches "recording" state but no `submitRecordedAudio` call occurs.

## Residual Risk / Test Gaps

- The fake-audio smoke test remains macOS-only, so Linux CI still does not exercise this recording path end-to-end.

## Fix Status

- Fixed by restoring a deterministic submission-hook assertion in `e2e/electron-ui.e2e.ts:350` and `e2e/electron-ui.e2e.ts:381`.
- Updated the test documentation summary in `docs/e2e-playwright.md`.
