# PR 138 Review

- PR: `#138`
- Commit: `9fd03f54293f9ad6b91555cea49871874c278762`
- Title: `docs(ui): clarify active vs default transform profiles (#127)`
- Review method: sub-agent (`explorer`) + manual validation

## Findings

- No findings.

## Residual Risk / Test Gaps

- Unit tests cover the clarified semantics, but there is still no end-to-end coverage proving capture/run-shortcut flows continue to use the default profile when the active profile differs.

## Fix Status

- No code changes required for this PR.
