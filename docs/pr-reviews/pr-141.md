# PR 141 Review

- Title: `feat(settings): add per-provider API key save buttons (#125)`
- Review method: sub-agent (`explorer`) + manual validation

## Findings

- Medium: The new single-provider `saveApiKey` error branch in `src/renderer/settings-mutations.ts:121` was not covered by tests in the reviewed commit. A regression in error toast/status/activity/logging behavior could slip through.

## Residual Risk / Test Gaps

- UI-level failure rendering for per-provider saves is still not covered by a component test; current coverage is mutation-unit level.

## Fix Status

- Fixed by adding a failure-path unit test for single-provider API key saves in `src/renderer/settings-mutations.test.ts:183`.
