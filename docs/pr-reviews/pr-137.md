# PR 137 Review

- Title: `chore(ui): simplify home transform shortcut copy (#126)`
- Review method: sub-agent (`explorer`) + manual validation

## Findings

- High: `e2e/electron-ui.e2e.ts:207`, `e2e/electron-ui.e2e.ts:242`, and `e2e/electron-ui.e2e.ts:564` (in the reviewed commit) still used the old button label `"Run Composite Transform"` after the PR renamed the Home button to `"Transform"`. Those Playwright selectors fail before assertions run.

## Residual Risk / Test Gaps

- I did not run the full Playwright suite in this environment, so runtime e2e verification of the updated selectors remains pending.

## Fix Status

- Fixed by updating the stale e2e selectors to the new button label in `e2e/electron-ui.e2e.ts:207`, `e2e/electron-ui.e2e.ts:242`, and `e2e/electron-ui.e2e.ts:609`.
