# PR 134 Review

- PR: `#134`

- Title: `fix(recording): message on idle stop and cancel (#124)`
- Review method: sub-agent (`explorer`) + manual validation

## Findings

- No findings.

## Residual Risk / Test Gaps

- The new idle guard is covered in `src/renderer/native-recording.test.ts:34`, but there is still no integration-level check that dispatching stop/cancel via the renderer command path (for example `src/renderer/renderer-app.tsx:250`) shows the info toast and clears busy UI state.

## Fix Status

- No code changes required for this PR.
