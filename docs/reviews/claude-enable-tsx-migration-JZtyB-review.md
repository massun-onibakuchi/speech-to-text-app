# PR Review: `claude/enable-tsx-migration-JZtyB`

## Scope
Migration from `.ts` (React `createElement`) to `.tsx` (JSX) across renderer components/tests, plus TSX toolchain wiring.

## Findings (Ordered by Severity)

### Low: Broken decision-doc reference in code comment
- **What**: `src/renderer/shell-chrome-react.tsx` references `docs/decisions/tsx-migration.md`, but that document is not present in the repository.
- **Why it matters**: This weakens migration traceability and makes future reviewers/operators chase non-existent design context.
- **Reference**: `src/renderer/shell-chrome-react.tsx:6`
- **Recommendation**: Add the referenced decision document or update the comment to an existing decision record.

## Test Migration Coverage

### What was validated
- Migrated renderer tests run successfully in isolation:
  - `src/renderer/home-react.test.tsx`
  - `src/renderer/settings-api-keys-react.test.tsx`
  - `src/renderer/settings-endpoint-overrides-react.test.tsx`
  - `src/renderer/settings-output-react.test.tsx`
  - `src/renderer/settings-recording-react.test.tsx`
  - `src/renderer/settings-save-react.test.tsx`
  - `src/renderer/settings-shortcut-editor-react.test.tsx`
  - `src/renderer/settings-shortcuts-react.test.tsx`
  - `src/renderer/settings-transformation-react.test.tsx`
  - `src/renderer/shell-chrome-react.test.tsx`
- Result: **10 test files passed, 16/16 tests passed**.

### Additional verification
- `pnpm run typecheck`: **pass**
- `pnpm run build`: **pass** (Electron main/preload/renderer bundles build successfully)

### Caveat on full test command
- `pnpm test` in this workspace fails due unrelated mirrored-worktree Electron installation issues (outside this PR’s changed code), while core branch-local migrated renderer suites pass.

## React Migration / Refactor Best-Practice Review

### Positive
- Migration is mostly mechanical and safe: event ownership, controlled input behavior, selectors/IDs, and callback contracts are preserved.
- JSX conversion reduces verbosity while maintaining component intent.
- Toolchain updates are coherent:
  - `tsconfig.json` sets `jsx: "react-jsx"`
  - `electron.vite.config.ts` enables `@vitejs/plugin-react` for renderer
  - `vitest.config.ts` enables `@vitejs/plugin-react` for TSX tests

### Gaps
- No dedicated integration/e2e assertion specifically for TSX renderer boot path after plugin addition.

## Risk Assessment

### Functional Regression Risk: Low
- Component behavior appears unchanged from pre-migration implementation.
- Targeted migrated tests, typecheck, and build all pass.

### Tooling/Build Risk: Low-Medium
- Renderer build now depends on `@vitejs/plugin-react`; currently validated by successful local build.
- Risk remains if CI/environment differs and lacks equivalent dependency/runtime setup.

### Testing Risk: Medium (Process/Infra)
- Full test command is noisy/non-deterministic in this workspace due external worktree duplication and Electron install state, which can mask PR signal.

## Overall Verdict
- **No high-severity migration defects found in this PR.**
- Merge risk is **low** for core TSX migration changes, with one cleanup action recommended (fix missing decision-doc reference) and one process recommendation (ensure clean CI signal for full test runs).
