  {"number":2,"title":"Make It Easy","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9010","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/easy.png","excerpt":"Streamline how it is used, reducing steps and effort to reach the goal as much as possible."},
  {"number":3,"title":"Mental Models","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9012","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/bookshelf.jpg","excerpt":"Match the structure and behavior to the user's imagined model. Provide learnable idioms (conventions) that give users a model. Use metaphors to convey concepts and functionality."},
  {"number":4,"title":"Signifiers","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9043","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/signifier.png","excerpt":"Make actionable elements visible and their meaning immediately clear. Use familiar expressions and obvious shapes to suggest how to use them. For example, make things that can be pressed look pressable, and things that cannot be pressed look unpressable."},
  {"number":5,"title":"Mapping","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9049","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/stove.png","excerpt":"Make the relationship between the controls and their effects easy to understand. Use cues like spatial arrangement, shape, color, and symbols."},
  {"number":6,"title":"Consistency","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9055","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/consistency.png","excerpt":"Apply consistent rules to color, shape, layout, behavior, and so on. Use the same expression for the same properties, and different expressions for different properties. Consistency embodies the design's logic and is a key cue for users to infer and learn how the system works."},
  {"number":7,"title":"User Control","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9058","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/windowsupdating.png","excerpt":"Let users control the system, not the other way around. Reduce actions forced by system constraints. Don't unilaterally restrict user behavior for the system's convenience. Ensure users can always choose and proceed based on their own intent."},
  {"number":8,"title":"Direct Manipulation","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9075","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/directmanipulation.png","excerpt":"Create the feeling of directly manipulating on-screen objects. Update the display in real time in response to physical actions (feedback). Make it possible to return to the previous state by performing the opposite action (reversibility)."},
  {"number":9,"title":"Be Modeless","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9094","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/modelessness.png","excerpt":"Eliminate modes as much as possible. In UI, a mode is when the meaning of an action changes depending on context, limiting what users can do or forcing a fixed sequence. A modeless UI lets users work in any order."},
  {"number":10,"title":"Visual Gestalt","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9099","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/pragnanz.png","excerpt":"Human perception is shaped by overall structure rather than recognizing elements independently (Gestalt psychology). Use patterns like proximity, similarity, and closure (the law of Pragnanz) to lay out elements and effectively show grouping relationships."},

For example, scissors constrain how you hold them via the handle shape so the blades are oriented correctly (easy to apply force and easy to see the cut)."},
  {"number":14,"title":"Precomputation","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9123","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/ricepot.jpg","excerpt":"Preset optimal values discovered by predecessors and reuse them in design. Examples include rice cooker markings, microwave cooking timers, automatic transmission shift timing, the target position in a bidet, and various program algorithms."},
  {"number":15,"title":"Prevent Errors","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9138","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/avoiderror.png","excerpt":"Make errors less likely. Clear error messages matter, but it's more important to design so errors don't happen. Clearly distinguish confusing options, and disable actions that are meaningless in the current context."},
  {"number":16,"title":"Fitts's Law","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9146","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/fittslaw.png","excerpt":"Pointing at on-screen elements with a mouse is faster when the target is closer and larger, and slower when it is farther and smaller. In other words, bigger and closer targets are easier to hit; smaller and farther targets are harder."},
  {"number":17,"title":"Hick's Law","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9177","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/hickslaw.png","excerpt":"Choosing one option takes time proportional to the number of options. Even if you know what you want, more options still take more time."},
  {"number":18,"title":"Conservation of Complexity","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9187","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/lawofconservationofcomplexity.png","excerpt":"There is a limit to how much you can simplify a process. You can't eliminate complexity; you can only move it. By moving complexity from the user to the system as much as possible, you can improve usability."},
  {"number":19,"title":"Task Coherence","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9194","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/taskcoherence.png","excerpt":"Users are likely to do today what they did yesterday. This is called task coherence. Remembering only what users last did can have the same effect as accurately predicting their behavior."},
  {"number":20,"title":"Optimize for Common Tasks","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9200","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/majortasks.png","excerpt":"Bring forward the information and features that match the tasks most users do. 80% of users use only 20% of features (the Pareto principle). Treating all demands equally makes the result hard to use for everyone, so prioritize major demands."},
  {"number":21,"title":"Persuasion","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9209","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/persuasion-reward.png","excerpt":"Use persuasive mechanisms to encourage user behavior.

  {"number":22,"title":"Provide Shortcuts","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9228","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/shortcuts.png","excerpt":"For frequent actions by experienced users, provide faster methods that reduce the usual step-by-step operation: keyboard shortcuts, bookmarks, gestures, history, etc."},
  {"number":23,"title":"Be Object-Based","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9240","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/objectbased.png","excerpt":"Extract objects from requirements and reflect them in the UI. If you only expose procedural steps as features, the system becomes inefficient and hard to understand. Identify the underlying objects so users can act on them directly to achieve goals."},
  {"number":24,"title":"Views Represent Objects","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9256","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/multipleviews.png","excerpt":"An interface is composed of a collection of views that represent objects (conceptual entities that are the focus of user interest). A single object can have different representations across multiple views."},
  {"number":25,"title":"Objects Embody Their State","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9267","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/iconstates.png","excerpt":"In a GUI, every on-screen object—icons, selectable items, controls, panes, windows—must continuously and visually embody its state in real time. Users change that state through interaction, bringing their work closer to a desired state."},
  {"number":26,"title":"Noun Then Verb","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9275","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/nounverb.png","excerpt":"Let users select the target (noun) first, then choose the action (verb). This is the basic GUI interaction order. If you make users choose the action first, you create a waiting-for-target state and reduce freedom."},
  {"number":27,"title":"Consistent Graphic Tone","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9282","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/toneandmanner.png","excerpt":"Keep tone and manner consistent across graphic elements: hue/saturation/brightness, gradients, borders, shadows, corner radius, fills and strokes, line thickness, representational vs abstract, and so on."},
  {"number":28,"title":"Communicate Meaning, Not Data","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9293","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/information.png","excerpt":"Users want meaning, not raw numbers. For example, they'd rather know what percentage of disk space remains than how many bytes are used. When buying a music player, they'd rather know how many songs it holds than the exact capacity."},
  {"number":29,"title":"Automate Single-Option Actions","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9299","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/automateoneoption.png","excerpt":"If there is only one permitted input action, making the user do it adds zero value. The system should do it automatically."},
  {"number":30,"title":"Keep Tools Near the Work","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9307","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/placethepennearthepaper.png","excerpt":"Place tools near the thing being worked on. If you must open another window while the object is visible, it's like getting up to search for a pen down the hall. Enable modeless, in-context actions and let users see results as they work."},
  {"number":31,"title":"Show Visually, Explain with Text","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9312","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/visuallyshowwhattextuallytellwhich.png","excerpt":"Make objects and their state understandable visually, and supplement with text. Use icons to convey the nature of items and labels to clarify. Use graphics to show information and numbers to provide detail."},
  {"number":32,"title":"Surface Prerequisites Early","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9318","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/presenteprerequisitesfirst.png","excerpt":"Ask for prerequisites early, not halfway through or at the end of a long procedure, or you may waste the user's effort. Examples include input information needed from outside the app and agreements users must accept."},
  {"number":33,"title":"Use Nouns in Navigation","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9323","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/nounfornavigationitems.png","excerpt":"When navigation items are phrased as verbs (things to do), it's harder to understand what's there, and building screens by action leads to many similar list screens. Create screens by information type, and use nouns for navigation."},
  {"number":34,"title":"Icons Represent Nouns or Adjectives","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9330","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/iconasnounoradjective.png","excerpt":"Base icons on the object they symbolize (a noun) or the resulting state (an adjective). Since processes (verbs) are hard to depict, avoid making them icons except for a few common ones."},
  {"number":35,"title":"Bind Data","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9340","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/databinding.png","excerpt":"When the same object is visible in multiple views at once, keep those views in sync. Two-way real-time updates let users feel they are acting directly on the object without worrying about internal processing."},
  {"number":36,"title":"Zero, One, Infinity","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9365","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/zerooneinfinity.png","excerpt":"Don't set arbitrary limits on counts. The number of elements should be 0, 1, or infinity. Don't limit things users can add, and ensure the UI doesn't break no matter how many there are."},
  {"number":37,"title":"Every Actionable Element Matters","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9386","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/everycontrolhasmeaning.png","excerpt":"Every currently actionable element or selectable item must have meaning for the user's task. Meaningless elements hinder tasks just by existing, so disable or hide them."},
  {"number":38,"title":"User Input Belongs to Users","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9398","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/changeyourname.png","excerpt":"Values and settings users enter should be saved by default. Items users add must be deletable by the user. Content users enter must be editable by the user."},
  {"number":39,"title":"Don't Ask for Inconsistent Inputs","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9408","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/inconsistentinput.png","excerpt":"Don't ask users to perform actions that could compromise data consistency. For example, don't make them enter both date of birth and age."},
  {"number":40,"title":"Give Forms a Narrative","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9421","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/giveformastory.png","excerpt":"Group input items into meaningful chunks. Order fields from familiar and simple first to complex later."},
  {"number":41,"title":"Create an Interaction Flow","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9429","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/flowofoperation.png","excerpt":"Use grouping and narrative ordering to guide users' eyes and actions. Action buttons suggest the end of the flow, so make the path to them easy to find."},
  {"number":42,"title":"Good Defaults","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9434","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/gooddefaults.png","excerpt":"Good defaults reduce user effort. Good defaults are lower-risk, more common, more neutral, reflect the current state, or reflect the user's past actions."},
  {"number":43,"title":"Use Constrained Controls","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9446","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/boundedcontrols.png","excerpt":"When inputs must be constrained, use appropriate controls like radio buttons, dropdowns, steppers, sliders, and pickers so only valid values can be entered."},
  {"number":44,"title":"Use Affirmative Wording","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9456","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/positivelabels.png","excerpt":"Make option text affirmative as much as possible. With on/off controls like radios and checkboxes, a negative label makes the act of selecting mean affirming a negation and is hard to understand."},
  {"number":45,"title":"Let Users Choose Outcomes","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9464","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/resultsratherthanvalues.png","excerpt":"Users often prefer selecting from options rather than typing. Instead of making them set parameter values directly, show the outcomes they can get and let them choose."},
  {"number":46,"title":"Structure Input Fields","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9470","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/structureinputcontrols-4.png","excerpt":"Split or constrain input fields to match the required format. This hints what to enter, improves efficiency, and reduces errors. But it can be less efficient than a simple text box, so consider the nature of the information and usage context."},
  {"number":47,"title":"Use Specific Verbs on Default Buttons","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9486","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/defaultbuttontitle.png","excerpt":"In modal dialogs and forms, label the default (primary) button with a concrete verb that describes the action (e.g., Save, Delete) rather than OK or Yes."},
  {"number":48,"title":"Radio vs Checkbox","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9492","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/radiobuttonandcheckbox.png","excerpt":"Use radio buttons for single selection from options (with a default). Checkboxes are independent on/off items and can be used for multi-select. Use radios for A-or-B; use checkboxes for true/false."},
  {"number":49,"title":"Avoid the Flip-Flop Problem","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9502","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/flipflop.png","excerpt":"When one button toggles on and off, it's unclear whether the label describes the current state or the state after pressing; this is the flip-flop problem. Avoid it by separating state display from the label."},
  {"number":50,"title":"Don't Demand Mechanical Precision","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9511","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/dontrequireaccuracy.png","excerpt":"Reduce input-format strictness imposed for system convenience. Absorb variations like case, punctuation, and separators, and normalize or autocomplete internally. Don't demand mechanical precision from users."},
  {"number":51,"title":"Provide Input Suggestions","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9515","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/inputsuggestion.png","excerpt":"Typing is costly, and users often prefer choosing. As they type, suggest what they were trying to enter or valuable values, effectively supporting the action."},
  {"number":52,"title":"Make It Look Scrollable","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9519","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/avoidthefalsebottom.png","excerpt":"If you want users to scroll a long vertical screen, don't align the bottom edge exactly with a content boundary, which can make it look unscrollable. Adjust content so it looks like there's more."},
  {"number":53,"title":"Show Previews in Choices","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9526","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/optionpreviews.png","excerpt":"When changing an object's style or choosing a tool, show the resulting state as previews in the choices. Seeing results before applying properties makes trial-and-error more efficient."},
  {"number":54,"title":"Fail-Safe Over Fool-Proof","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9530","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/failsafe.png","excerpt":"It's more important to be fail-safe (okay even if users make mistakes) than fool-proof (impossible to make mistakes). If everything can be undone, mistakes effectively disappear and all actions become part of productive exploration."},
  {"number":55,"title":"Constructive Error Messages","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9535","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/constructiveerrorindications.png","excerpt":"When errors occur, help users understand and act with clear messages. Tell them what happened and what to do next. Error codes are useless for most users. Avoid overblown wording."},
  {"number":56,"title":"Possibility vs Probability","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9540","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/savedialog.png","excerpt":"Don't make normal use cumbersome by over-considering rare events. Designers should emphasize the main case. Treating main-case and edge-case features side by side makes interfaces complex and harms normal use."},
  {"number":57,"title":"Execute Quietly","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9547","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/dodontask.png","excerpt":"Don't ask for confirmation for everything or report every successful completion. Provide modeless feedback via changes on the screen, not dialogs. Ask for confirmation only for irreversible actions or those that may cause data loss."},
  {"number":58,"title":"Have the Guts to Simplify","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9585","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/guts.png","excerpt":"If you try to satisfy every design requirement, you may never ship anything coherent. Design requires the guts to make trade-offs. Prioritizing completeness and strictness too much can add options and obscure the core intent."},
  {"number":59,"title":"Wayfinding","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9623","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/wayfinding.png","excerpt":"Provide signposts so users don't get lost in an information space: where they are, where they can go, what's nearby, how to go back, etc. Use a consistent navigation scheme so users can grasp the overall structure."},
  {"number":60,"title":"Escape Hatch","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9627","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/escapehatch.png","excerpt":"Provide an escape hatch so users can always return quickly to the starting place. In home-based navigation or when entering a specific mode, make it easy to get back to the base screen when users feel lost or want to stop."},
  {"number":61,"title":"Immediate Gratification","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9652","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/instantgratification.png","excerpt":"Ensure users can experience success within a few seconds of starting to use the product. Show the most basic working screen or object list as early as possible so they can start immediately, and help them feel they are making legitimate progress."},
  {"number":62,"title":"Defer Decisions","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9656","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/deferredchoices.png","excerpt":"Don't demand every decision upfront. Allow users to defer non-essential answers: use some features without an account, create records without filling every attribute, etc. In forms, require only fields whose necessity is clear."},
  {"number":63,"title":"Animate State Changes","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9675","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/animatescreenchanges.png","excerpt":"When changing a large portion of the screen, add transition animation so users can understand continuity between states. Show intermediate steps over about 0.1-0.5 seconds."},
  {"number":64,"title":"Bidirectional Transitions","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9711","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/reversaltransitions.png","excerpt":"When animating a transition from state A to B, also animate the reverse transition from B back to A. Corresponding direction helps users form a correct mental model of the information space."},

Around 0.1 seconds is the limit where users feel it is instantaneous. Up to 1 second is tolerable without breaking their train of thought. Beyond about 10 seconds, show progress and remaining time."},
  {"number":66,"title":"Feedback Near the Action","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9729","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/feedbackneartheoperation.png","excerpt":"When indicating system state changes in response to user actions, give feedback near where the user is looking. If it's an action on a selected object, change the object itself. If it's a single button, indicate it near that button."},
  {"number":67,"title":"Progressive Disclosure","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9733","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/progressivedisclosure.png","excerpt":"Hide advanced features at first so beginners can start easily, and reveal them when needed or when the user is ready. This enables staged learning."},

  {"number":69,"title":"Account for Label Length in Localization","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9740","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/labellength.png","excerpt":"Average word length differs by language. German is generally long (about 1.4x English on average) and is useful for quick layout stress tests. Conversely, CJK and Korean labels are shorter, so ensure buttons and such don't become too small to tap."},
  {"number":70,"title":"Avoid Ambiguous Symbols","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9747","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/circleandcross.png","excerpt":"In Japan, ○ and × mean good and bad, but these nuances differ by culture, so such symbols may not communicate in international interfaces. For example, × can be used with a positive nuance meaning a checkmark."},
  {"number":71,"title":"Prefer Conventions","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9752","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/idiomatic.png","excerpt":"UI is often said to be best when it's intuitive, but what people often mean is conventional. Double-clicking to open files and pinching to zoom must be learned at first. Use idioms people already know, and if proposing new interactions, make them naturally learnable and eventually conventional."},
  {"number":72,"title":"Follow Platform Button Order","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9758","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/buttonorder.png","excerpt":"For confirm/cancel button order in dialogs, prioritize user habit and follow platform rules. If there is no clear rule, follow the common sense that left is back and right is forward, and put the confirm button on the right."},
  {"number":73,"title":"Keep Menu Items Stable","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9762","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/dontchangethepositionofmenuitems.png","excerpt":"In menus listing actions or navigation items, keep item positions stable across contexts. Users remember the location spatially; if positions change, they can't learn."},
  {"number":74,"title":"Minimal Highlight Changes","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9770","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/highlight.png","excerpt":"To highlight one item among peers, change only one visual component (or add only one). If the change is too large, it stops reading as a highlight and looks like a different kind of element."},
  {"number":75,"title":"Consider Optical Illusions","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9773","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/opticalillusions.png","excerpt":"Unifying sizes, shapes, positions, and colors helps consistency, but depending on composition, optical illusions can cause unintended appearance. Know common illusion patterns and adjust visually when needed."},
  {"number":76,"title":"Support Spatial Memory","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9776","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/spatialmemory.png","excerpt":"Let users place objects anywhere on a 2D surface and remember them spatially.

Gestures that simply trigger commands via predetermined symbolic motions are hard to learn because the mapping is arbitrary."},

For RTL languages, reverse left and right."},

For RTL languages, reverse left and right relationships."},
  {"number":82,"title":"Mobile: Hierarchical Over Comprehensive","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9801","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/hierarchicalratherthancomprehensive.png","excerpt":"Desktop apps benefit from showing a comprehensive overview, but on mobile it's better to limit information shown at once and present it hierarchically."},

Don't let tasks that were easy in a simple product require complex operations in a mature one."},
  {"number":84,"title":"Don't Overuse Color or Type","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9812","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/fewcolorsandfonts.png","excerpt":"Colors and typefaces can emphasize elements and indicate groups, but using too many makes screens messy; use them sparingly."},

Use repetition and consistency in spacing and alignment. This creates visual stability and logically conveys structure."},
  {"number":86,"title":"Don't Rely on Customization","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9819","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/wordprefs.png","excerpt":"Relying on customization to handle slightly different needs per user increases complexity and can reduce learnability and maintainability. Decide on the best UI spec first, and offer customization cautiously and minimally."},
  {"number":87,"title":"Make It the User's Tool","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9824","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/belongtouser.png","excerpt":"Build the system as something that belongs to users, not providers. It should not be a tool to impose provider demands, but a tool that amplifies users' actions. Think of it not as something that makes users do things, but something users use to do things."},
  {"number":88,"title":"Let Users Work Their Way","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9830","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/iphone-1.png","excerpt":"Prefer modeless tools over procedures that must be memorized.

UI locking is when processing takes so long that results don't appear and the UI stops accepting the next action. If the UI is locked for more than a few seconds, users lose the feeling that they freely control the application."},

Provide illusions such as infinitely nestable folders or instantly delivered email."},
  {"number":99,"title":"Design Proposes New Meaning","url":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9928","image":"https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/assets/images/shig/meaning-streetview.jpg","excerpt":"Many innovative designs draw on external cues like understanding user needs and researching behavior, but their essence appears as proposals of meaning born from designers' internal reflection.
