    "excerpt": "Build the system as something that belongs to users, not providers. It should not be a tool to impose provider demands, but a tool that amplifies users' actions. Think of it not as something that makes users do things, but something users use to do things."

    "url": "https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9852",
    "excerpt": "If users have domain experience, they should be able to use the system on their own. Don't write usage instructions into the interface; make the interface self-explanatory so how to use it is obvious."

    "url": "https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9855",
    "excerpt": "In a GUI, work proceeds by repeating: 1. user action -> 2. processing -> 3. result display. UI locking is when processing takes so long that results don't appear and the UI stops accepting the next action. If the UI is locked for more than a few seconds, users lose the feeling that they freely control the application."

    "url": "https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9869",
    "excerpt": "Users want to achieve goals, not play a game (unless it is a game app). Don't include game-like elements in interfaces: randomness, surprise, gambling, obscurity, speed demands, dexterity demands, intuition demands, and so on."

    "title": "Move as Users Intend",
    "url": "https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9876",
    "excerpt": "Interfaces should respond to user input, but to make users feel in control, don't reflect raw input-device values directly; include appropriate slack and correction."

    "title": "Increase Hot Spots",
    "url": "https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9887",
    "excerpt": "Make the tappable or clickable area for buttons larger than the visible rectangle. This balances visual design with ease of pressing. But don't separate the visible element from the hotspot."

    "title": "Don't Rely on Color",
    "url": "https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9907",
    "excerpt": "Don't make the interface depend on color. Ensure information is conveyed without color using contrast, borders and underlines, mapping by shape or position, and textual annotations. Verify by viewing the interface in grayscale."

    "title": "Let Users Work at Their Pace",
    "url": "https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9913",
    "excerpt": "Don't impose time limits on actions. Don't change operation validity based on timing. Don't require fast reflexes. Users want control, not challenge (except games)."

    "url": "https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9916",
    "excerpt": "Through capacity and speed, computers can hide internal mechanisms and present objects within a virtual world so users can focus. Provide illusions such as infinitely nestable folders or instantly delivered email."

    "url": "https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/9928",
    "excerpt": "Many innovative designs draw on external cues like understanding user needs and researching behavior, but their essence appears as proposals of meaning born from designers' internal reflection. Design doesn't only solve problems; it leads to new ways of seeing things."

    "excerpt": "Tool design is not merely for short-term goal achievement. It serves humanity by being tolerant of human shortcomings and enhancing human strengths, enriching life. We inherit the culture accumulated within design."
