Goal (incl. success criteria):
- Sync current worktree with latest `main`, remove FFmpeg dependency, keep recording functional with selectable audio source, and ensure STT flow is implemented/verified with ElevenLabs-focused tests.
- Review commit `cb27ce6` on `fix/ffmpeg-removal` (vs its parent and `origin/main`) for regressions/bugs/risky behavior and document missing tests.
- Fast diff review report (max five high-impact observations) focusing on recording command dispatch, shortcut routing, audio device fallback, and newly added tests.
- Success criteria:
  - Branch is synchronized with latest upstream `main` changes.
  - No runtime/build dependency on FFmpeg remains.
  - Recording supports selectable audio source when multiple devices are available.
  - Recording->STT pipeline works for configured providers, with explicit ElevenLabs test coverage.
  - Diff findings include severity, file refs, and fixes for the requested focus areas.

Constraints/Assumptions:
- Follow repository/local instructions from AGENTS.md.
- User-corrected requirements take precedence over previous draft assumptions.
- Prefer minimal-risk migration path that preserves existing IPC/settings contracts where possible.

Key decisions:
- Update both product spec and UI requirements docs where requirements changed.
- Create separate GitHub issues for each testing problem to support parallel tracking.
- Priority order for execution:
  1) `#9` API key settings area (unblocks transform usability)
  2) `#7` transform button clipboard execution reliability
  3) `#10` configurable/working shortcuts
  4) `#11` multi-preset transformation settings
  5) `#8` FFmpeg unsupported-state UX alignment
- Current open-issue priority (derived from issue criticality/scope text):
  1) `#15` `[P1]` global toast notifications for blocked/failure UX
  2) `#19` `[P2]` Groq split-tunnel diagnostics integration
  3) `#16` `[P2]` API key settings UX completion (show/hide + test connection)
  4) `#18` `[P3]` remaining settings actions
  5) `#1` legacy Playwright setup issue (potentially redundant with closed `#12`; evaluate close/merge)
- PR review baseline for this pass is `fix/ffmpeg-removal` against `origin/main`, including local uncommitted changes in:
  - `/workspace/CONTINUITY.md`
  - `/workspace/e2e/electron-ui.e2e.ts`
  - `/workspace/src/renderer/main.ts`

State:
 - Done: patched reviewed PR issues, committed, and pushed to remote branch.
 - Now: reviewing commit `cb27ce6` (global shortcut error propagation) per user request.
 - Next: deliver severity-ranked review findings and missing test coverage for the new IPC channel.

Done:
- Hardened history store validation to treat invalid JSON structure as corruption (not just parse errors):
  - `/workspace/src/main/services/history-service.ts`
  - Added runtime `isHistoryStore` guard (`records` must be array) with same backup-and-recover flow.
- Extended unit tests:
  - `/workspace/src/main/services/history-service.test.ts`
  - Added: `recovers when history JSON is valid but has invalid structure`.
- Extended E2E regression suite:
  - `/workspace/e2e/electron-ui.e2e.ts`
  - Added: `recovers from structurally invalid persisted history on launch`.
- Validation:
  - `npm run test -- src/main/services/history-service.test.ts` passed (3 tests).
  - `npm run build && xvfb-run -a npx playwright test e2e/electron-ui.e2e.ts -g "recovers from (malformed|structurally invalid) persisted history on launch"` passed (2 tests).
- Added E2E regression coverage for corrupted persisted history:
  - `/workspace/e2e/electron-ui.e2e.ts`
  - New test: `recovers from malformed persisted history on launch`
  - Test seeds malformed JSON at `XDG_CONFIG_HOME/SpeechToText/history/records.json` before app launch and asserts no `History refresh failed` toast on refresh.
- Refactored E2E launch fixture to shared helper for reusable env injection:
  - `/workspace/e2e/electron-ui.e2e.ts` (`launchElectronApp`)
- Validation:
  - `npm run build && xvfb-run -a npx playwright test e2e/electron-ui.e2e.ts -g "recovers from malformed persisted history on launch"` passed.
- Investigated reported startup error text around renderer `loadHistory()`; source and packaged bundle code are intact (no `atestDiagnostic` corruption in current artifacts).
- Hardened history persistence loading against malformed JSON:
  - `/workspace/src/main/services/history-service.ts`
  - behavior: catch parse/read failures, backup corrupted file to `records.json.corrupt.<timestamp>`, continue with empty store.
- Added regression tests:
  - `/workspace/src/main/services/history-service.test.ts`
  - covers malformed JSON recovery and successful append after recovery.
- Validation:
  - `npm run test -- src/main/services/history-service.test.ts` passed.
  - `npm run test` passed (66 tests).
- Rebuilt mac arm64 ZIP artifact with recovery fix:
  - `npm run build && npx electron-builder --mac zip --publish never --arm64`
  - `/workspace/dist/SpeechToText-0.1.0-arm64-mac.zip`
  - `/workspace/dist/SpeechToText-0.1.0-arm64-mac.zip.blockmap`
- Attempted `npm run dist:mac -- --arm64`; build phase passed but failed on Linux due missing optional DMG dependency `dmg-license`.
- Attempt to install `dmg-license` failed on Linux (`EBADPLATFORM`, darwin-only package).
- Executed ZIP-only mac arm64 build successfully:
  - `npm run build && npx electron-builder --mac zip --publish never --arm64`
  - Produced:
    - `/workspace/dist/SpeechToText-0.1.0-arm64-mac.zip`
    - `/workspace/dist/SpeechToText-0.1.0-arm64-mac.zip.blockmap`
- Completed fresh spec-vs-code review against:
  - `/workspace/specs/v1-spec.md`
  - `/workspace/specs/ui-components-requirements.md`
- Identified concrete gaps for:
  - settings persistence across app restart
  - interface mode parity (`standard_app` vs `menu_bar_utility`)
  - required disabled-state behavior for recording/transform action buttons
  - fixed retry policy (`network_retries: 2`) implementation
  - secret storage contract drift from keychain-only behavior
- Verified current `specs/v1-spec.md` still contains FFmpeg-enabled/disabled behavior that conflicts with new requirement.
- Verified GitHub auth is active and open issues currently: `#1`, `#2`, `#3`.
- Updated `/workspace/specs/v1-spec.md`:
  - Added multi-preset transformation requirements (default + selected execution + shortcut behavior).
  - Marked FFmpeg recording implementation as out of v1 scope/deferred.
  - Updated recording lifecycle to unsupported-state guidance for v1.
  - Updated settings contract for transformation presets and shortcut behavior.
  - Updated validation and acceptance tests for clipboard-topmost transform execution, configurable shortcuts, v1 recording unsupported state, and API key settings visibility.
- Updated `/workspace/specs/ui-components-requirements.md`:
  - H-02 now requires transform action on current clipboard topmost text.
  - S-02 now requires multiple transformation presets, default selection, selected execution, and shortcut editing.
  - S-03 now defines FFmpeg as unsupported-state UX for v1.
  - Acceptance checklist aligned with above changes.

- Implemented `#11`:
  - Added transformation preset schema (`activePresetId`, `defaultPresetId`, `presets[]`) in `/workspace/src/shared/domain.ts`.
  - Added preset integrity validation in settings validation.
  - Processing pipeline now uses default preset; composite transform uses active preset:
    - `/workspace/src/main/orchestrators/processing-orchestrator.ts`

    - `/workspace/src/renderer/main.ts`
  - Updated orchestrator tests for preset model.
  - Closed issue `#11`.
- Implemented `#8`:
  - Recording orchestrator now returns explicit v1 unsupported guidance for recording commands:
    - `/workspace/src/main/orchestrators/recording-orchestrator.ts`

- Implemented `.env` API key support for Gemini E2E usage:
  - `SecretStore` now falls back to in-process volatile storage when macOS keychain (`security`) is unavailable, and falls back to env vars (`GROQ_APIKEY`, `ELEVENLABS_APIKEY`, `GOOGLE_APIKEY`) for reads:
    - `/workspace/src/main/services/secret-store.ts`
  - Added regression tests for secret-store fallback behavior:
    - `/workspace/src/main/services/secret-store.test.ts`

    - Provider API key inputs
    - Live Gemini transform path
- Validation:
  - `npm run test` passed (55 tests).
  - `npm run test:e2e` passed (6 tests).
- Posted completion comment and closed issue `#3`.
- Current open issues after closure: `#1` only.
- User requested spec-vs-code comparison and issue creation with priority-based plan.
- Completed spec-vs-code gap scan against:

- Created new gap issues:
  - `#13` `[P1] Implement main-process global hotkeys (HotkeyService)`
  - `#14` `[P1] Align Home Transform card with prerequisite and status requirements`
  - `#15` `[P1] Implement global toast notifications for blocked/failure UX`

    - `npm run test:e2e` passed (10 tests).
  - Posted completion comment and closed issue `#1`.
  - Current open issues: none.
- Investigated runtime persistence path source for post-cleanup startup issue:
  - History storage is resolved from `app.getPath('userData')` in `/workspace/src/main/services/history-service.ts`.
  - Package metadata uses `productName: "SpeechToText"` in `/workspace/package.json`, so the macOS user-data directory is expected to be `~/Library/Application Support/SpeechToText` (not `speech-to-text-v1`).
- Verified branch sync status:
  - `fix/ffmpeg-removal` is synchronized with `origin/main` (`git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main` => `0 0`).
- Removed FFmpeg dependency and runtime usage:
  - Removed `ffmpeg-static` from `/workspace/package.json` and refreshed lockfiles:
    - `/workspace/pnpm-lock.yaml`
    - `/workspace/package-lock.json`
  - Deleted FFmpeg-based implementation/tests:
    - `/workspace/src/main/infrastructure/ffmpeg-runner.ts`
    - `/workspace/src/main/infrastructure/ffmpeg-runner.test.ts`
    - `/workspace/src/main/services/capture-service.ts`
    - `/workspace/src/main/services/capture-service.test.ts`
- Migrated recording architecture to native recorder IPC model:
  - Added renderer command listener + native `MediaRecorder` start/stop/cancel and audio submission:
    - `/workspace/src/renderer/main.ts`
  - Added IPC contract/channels for recording command broadcast + audio submission:
    - `/workspace/src/shared/ipc.ts`
    - `/workspace/src/preload/index.ts`
    - `/workspace/src/main/ipc/register-handlers.ts`
  - Updated recording orchestrator to dispatch recording commands and persist submitted audio for queue processing:
    - `/workspace/src/main/orchestrators/recording-orchestrator.ts`
    - `/workspace/src/main/services/capture-types.ts`
    - `/workspace/src/main/services/job-queue-service.ts`
  - Updated settings domain to remove deprecated FFmpeg flags:
    - `/workspace/src/shared/domain.ts`
    - `/workspace/src/main/services/settings-service.test.ts`
- Added/updated tests for migration and ElevenLabs scope:
  - `/workspace/src/main/orchestrators/recording-orchestrator.test.ts`
  - `/workspace/src/main/services/transcription/elevenlabs-transcription-adapter.test.ts`
  - `/workspace/src/main/services/hotkey-service.test.ts`
- Validation after migration:
  - `npm run typecheck` passed.
  - `npm run test` passed (72 tests).
  - `npm run build` passed.
  - `npm run test:e2e` passed (12 passed, 2 skipped live-provider tests).
- Published migration commit and branch:
  - Commit: `521b00b` (`refactor: remove ffmpeg capture and use native recording pipeline`)
  - Push: `origin/fix/ffmpeg-removal`
- CI check:
  - Triggered workflow dispatch for `Electron E2E (Playwright)` on `fix/ffmpeg-removal`.
  - Run: `https://github.com/massun-onibakuchi/speech-to-text-app/actions/runs/22055863057`
  - Result: `success` (job `electron-e2e`, ~1m18s).
- Debug patch for silent recording feedback:
  - Added preflight API key check before starting native recording (clear error for missing Groq/ElevenLabs key):
    - `/workspace/src/renderer/main.ts`
  - Added post-stop polling of persisted history by `capturedAt` and surfaced terminal outcome as activity/toast:
    - `/workspace/src/renderer/main.ts`
  - This addresses lack of visible response when processing fails or when result is delayed.
- Validation of debug patch:
  - `npm run typecheck` passed.
  - `npm run test -- src/main/services/transcription/elevenlabs-transcription-adapter.test.ts src/main/orchestrators/recording-orchestrator.test.ts` passed.
  - `npm run build && xvfb-run -a npx playwright test e2e/electron-ui.e2e.ts -g "shows error toast when recording command fails"` passed.
- Live STT verification with `.env` ElevenLabs key:
  - Loaded env from `/workspace/.env` (without printing secrets).
  - Executed direct provider call to `POST https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/speech-to-text` with generated 1s WAV sample and `model_id=scribe_v2`.
  - Result: `HTTP 200`.
  - Response snippet: `{\"language_code\":\"en\", ... \"text\":\"\", ...}` (empty transcript expected for silent audio sample).
- Added E2E coverage for recording preflight API-key guard:
  - `/workspace/e2e/electron-ui.e2e.ts`
  - New test: `blocks start recording when STT API key is missing`
  - Test clears Groq key via IPC and verifies exact Home toast message:
    - `Missing Groq API key. Add it in Settings > Provider API Keys.`
- Validation:
  - `npm run build && xvfb-run -a npx playwright test e2e/electron-ui.e2e.ts -g "blocks start recording when STT API key is missing|shows error toast when recording command fails"` passed (2 tests).
- Sub-agent PR review completed (`explorer` agent) for `fix/ffmpeg-removal` vs `origin/main`; findings:
  - High: recording command flow can silently no-op when renderer is unavailable (main process dispatch-only path has no fallback/error surfacing):
    - `/workspace/src/main/ipc/register-handlers.ts`
    - `/workspace/src/renderer/main.ts`
  - Medium: recording device fallback compares persisted device id against label, so label fallback path cannot trigger as intended:
    - `/workspace/src/renderer/main.ts`
  - Missing tests:
    - No automated coverage for renderer recording lifecycle (`MediaRecorder` start/stop/cancel -> `submitRecordedAudio` -> `pollRecordingOutcome`) success/failure paths.
    - Existing E2E additions mainly validate missing-API-key and command-failure toast paths.
- Fixed high-severity recording command dispatch no-op risk:
  - Added renderer-safe delivery helper with destroyed/crashed/send-failure guarding:
    - `/workspace/src/main/ipc/recording-command-dispatcher.ts`
  - `runRecordingCommand` now throws when no active renderer received command:
    - `/workspace/src/main/ipc/register-handlers.ts`
  - Added coverage:
    - `/workspace/src/main/ipc/recording-command-dispatcher.test.ts`
- Fixed global shortcut recording no-op path:
  - `HotkeyService` now calls injected `runRecordingCommand` handler (main dispatch path) instead of bare `recordingOrchestrator.runCommand`.
  - Shortcut callback now safely handles promise rejection.
  - Files:
    - `/workspace/src/main/services/hotkey-service.ts`
    - `/workspace/src/main/ipc/register-handlers.ts`
    - `/workspace/src/main/services/hotkey-service.test.ts`
- Fixed medium-severity audio source fallback issue:
  - Added dedicated recording-device resolver utilities with fallback-by-detected-label behavior when configured device id changes:
    - `/workspace/src/renderer/recording-device.ts`
  - Settings save now persists selected device label into `recording.detectedAudioSource`.
  - Recording start now resolves device id via helper using configured id + detected label fallback.
  - Files:
    - `/workspace/src/renderer/main.ts`
    - `/workspace/src/renderer/recording-device.test.ts`
- Validation after fixes:
  - `npm run test -- src/main/ipc/recording-command-dispatcher.test.ts src/main/services/hotkey-service.test.ts src/renderer/recording-device.test.ts` passed.
  - `npm run typecheck` passed.
  - `npm run test` passed (80 tests).
  - `npm run build && xvfb-run -a npx playwright test e2e/electron-ui.e2e.ts -g "shows error toast when recording command fails|blocks start recording when STT API key is missing"` passed (2 tests).
- Commit/push:
  - Commit: `26d9537` (`fix: harden recording command dispatch and device fallback`)
  - Pushed: `origin/fix/ffmpeg-removal` (`521b00b..26d9537`)
- Sub-agent review execution attempt:
  - Spawned multiple sub-agents (`explorer`, `default`) for branch review.
  - Wait calls timed out with no returned payload in this session.
  - Fallback: direct/manual review performed against `origin/main...HEAD`.
- Follow-up fix for review finding "hotkey errors swallowed":
  - Added main->renderer hotkey error event contract:
    - `/workspace/src/shared/ipc.ts`
    - `/workspace/src/preload/index.ts`
  - Hotkey service now reports callback failures and registration failures via `onShortcutError` instead of swallowing:
    - `/workspace/src/main/services/hotkey-service.ts`
  - Main IPC now logs and broadcasts hotkey errors:
    - `/workspace/src/main/ipc/register-handlers.ts`
  - Renderer now surfaces hotkey errors as activity/toast:
    - `/workspace/src/renderer/main.ts`
  - Added regression tests for:
    - callback rejection reporting
    - registration failure reporting
    - `/workspace/src/main/services/hotkey-service.test.ts`
- Validation after follow-up fix:
  - `npm run test -- src/main/services/hotkey-service.test.ts src/main/ipc/recording-command-dispatcher.test.ts` passed.
  - `npm run test` passed (82 tests).
  - `npm run typecheck` passed.

Now:
- Follow-up fix is implemented and validated; preparing user handoff.

Next:
- Commit/push follow-up fix if user requests.

Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
- Whether `menu_bar_utility` is intentionally de-scoped despite still being in `specs/v1-spec.md` (UNCONFIRMED).
- Whether legacy FFmpeg references in older docs (`specs/spec.md`, `specs/ARCTECTURE.md`) should be cleaned in this same task or tracked separately (UNCONFIRMED).
